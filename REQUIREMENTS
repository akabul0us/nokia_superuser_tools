This collection of tools makes use of various common command-line tools that 
should be present (or available) in nearly every distribition of GNU/Linux, namely:

bash
curl
sed
xargs
cut
grep

It also makes use of other rather common commmand line tools that it might be necessary to explicitly install:

python3 (with Crypto/Pycryptodome module)
unix2dos
ssh (OpenSSH or Dropbear)
nmap

Finally, it makes use of some less common packages which you will likely need to add:

urlencode (https://github.com/dead10ck/urlencode)
ipinfo (https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)
sshpass (https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass)

Additionally, in order to transfer files to/from exploited devices, 
you may wish to install one or more of the following:

python3 module http.server
netcat
ngrok (or another tunneling service)

If any scripts fail because you're missing one of these packages, search your package manager.

Those who wish to use these tools on Android (via Termux) will have to setup several tools not included by default. 

MacOSX users may download and setup macports, homebrew, or both to easily add necessary packages, 
however this operating system is not a main target for these tools so you will have to figure this out by yourself.

Windows is not supported (nor will it ever be), although if you are stuck using 
Windows there ought to be a way to get these tools working on it. That's up to you.

iOS is not supported, although if you jailbreak an iPhone and add these tools to the Darwin shell, 
please send us a screenshot, as that would be hilarious.

*BSD users should not encounter issues (unless there are Linux-isms which have gone unnoticed)
although none of these tools have been explicitly tested under *BSD.
